( 2 ) What is the worst - case scenario ? ( 3 ) What would the social effects of this be ? ( 4 ) What would the financial impact of this be ? and ( 5 ) How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience ? Your answer to that fifth and crucial question will point you to buffers – perhaps adding another 20 per cent to the project’s budget , or getting a PR person on board to handle any potential negative press , or calling a board meeting to manage shareholder expectations – that you can create to safeguard you against unknowable events .</h3>

If a child read a book for thirty minutes , he or she would earn an additional token , which could also be traded in for screen time or for money .
